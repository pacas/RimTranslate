# Installation for Windows

Installing dependencies for Windows is little bit complicated so here quick walktrough.

First, you need to install Python itself. Download Python 3.10.x (tested on this version - you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)). You can install either 32- or 64-bit. During installing you may check option "Add python to PATH variable" for ease of use later (you need to restart system for apply).

Then, just launch command-line console (PowerShell or cmd.exe) and type 
`python -m pip install polib`
`python -m pip install lxml`

Now you ready for actual work.
